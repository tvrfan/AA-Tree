# AA-Tree
Binary Balanced Search Tree. Simple code with recursion.    
This is a fork of JuYanYan/AA-Tree, then modified to use STRUCT data structures, each in its own tree.

It requires each structure to begin with NODE declaration, so saves a data pointer, and makes code a library where any declared struct can be used and retrieved
without extra code. 
It changes so that there is a TREE structure which contains the root node and subroutines for print and compare to allow different sturctures to be handled in same code
