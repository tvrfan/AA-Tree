# AA-Tree
Binary Balanced Search Tree. Simple code with recursion.    
This is a fork of JuYanYan/AA-Tree, modified to use different data structures each in its own tree.  It requires each structre begines with NODE declaration, so saves a data pointer and makes code a library where any declared struct can be used and retrieved
